# My project

## The structure of your project
1. I grab all the elements which I was going to use.

2. I work on showing the list of food. I used map to create the html element and append it to the list of food.

3. I updated the spicy checkbox. When it is checked, all the spicy food appear. 

4. I updated the vegetarian checkbox. When it is checked, all the vegetarian food appear.

5. When all the checkboxes are checked, all the spicy and vegetarian food appear.

6. I also hve updated the add buttons, when they are clicked the order food appears.

If I have more I could finish all the exercise.

## I could not answer to all the questions because I still cleaned my codes. Thanks!
